Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
-  **Quality Over Quantity**: Only add resources you've personally vetted. Prioritize maintained projects, up-to-date tutorials (Solidity ^0.8.x+), and authoritative sources.

-  **No Duplicates**: Search existing entries before submitting. If a similar resource exists, explain why yours adds unique value.

-  **Solidity-Specific Focus**: Exclude general Ethereum/Web3 resources unless they have substantial Solidity-specific content.

-  **Proper Formatting**:
- Use `[Resource Name](URL)` with a **1-sentence description** (e.g., "*Library for gas-efficient contracts*").

- Keep categories **alphabetically ordered**.

-  **Category Alignment**: Place resources in the most specific relevant category. If suggesting a new category, open an Issue first for discussion.

**Before submitting**:

1. Verify links work

2. Follow the [PR Template](./pull_request_template.md) (if available)

3. Ensure English-only or clearly marked multilingual content

Thank you for your contributions to making this list a valuable resource for the Solidity community!

**Updating your PR**
A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
